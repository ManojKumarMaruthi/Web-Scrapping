0,Go for any other company rather than this company if are investing huge money.,OnePlus you trash I bought new OnePlus 6t on January for 38k- 128gb 6gb-ram varient and now OnePlus 7 is launched for for 33k-128gb 6gb varient. What kind of game is this brand playing with its customers. Seriously you wanna be Apple started increasing price of your phone and now when you realise that it's not possible for you to stay in the market you decreased the price of your next phone. This shows how week one plus is. It doesn't have the balls to compete and retain its customers.,1.0

33,Not worth money.,"One plus 6t was marketed as best smartphone of the market but it's not. I have used this for 3-4 months to tell difference. Before this I've used MI phone and they are better when it comes to user interface.Cons1. On screen fingerprint sensor is horrible. Face detection is horrible. Night time u have to use ur code to unlock ur phone.2. If you have google chromecast then one plus is a bad choice. U cannot caste amazing time video on TV. U can caste device but it'll show blind screen. Also u cannot watch HD quality on Netflix.3. It has major glich for sound. Sometimes u cannot reduce or increase sound it'll stay the same. If u r listening song and u connect bullet headphones then sound doesn't transfer to headphone, it'll continue from mobile speakers. Also it has lot of issues with Bluetooth, when disconnected from car Bluetooth device there is problem again with sound button. U have to restart ur phone to make it workable. The problem with is sound button is actually software problem and it's very annoying.4. It doesn't have IR sensor for universal remote. Which is very useful.Pros1. It's very fast.2. Camera is good quality.3. Speed charging is very good. I get full battery within 40 minute charge.Overall I am bit disappointed using this phone because they have not done proper research on user interface. Doesn't give premium feeling. My previous MI phone was very good in that case. Absolutely not worth 40k.",3.0

107,Shifting from Moto G5 plus to OnePlus 6T,This is the best phone I ever used so far. Face recognition works like a thunder and the onscreen fingerprint is fast but not as fast as OnePlus 6. And there is 0% issues with performance but Being a heavy user I use my phone more often so the battery dries up by end of the day.

120,"Love the phone, but the fingerprint and face recognition needs some work","Love the phone - it's one of the best flagships out there. I bought it at full price a couple of months back.Pros:1. Fast2. Clean OS3. Plenty of internal storage4. OnePlus - a thing of beauty5. Great camera with great portrait and night modes6. Timely updates7. Free silicon case of great quality providedCons:1. Heats up when you use it continuously, even for simple activities such as browsing Quora2. In-display fingerprint sensor is quite slow. Considering I have used almost all the OnePlus models (and currently own both the 6 and 6T), the sensor is considerably slower than the counterpart3. I also use an iPhone XS Max which has only facial recognition and compared to it, the face recognition in 6T is so poor that it barely works. I have come to not rely on it at all4. A bit heavy if you use it for a long time in one hand - the phone with a tempered glass and the default OnePlus case tends to get heavyAreas for OnePlus to improve before they call themselves a flagship killer. But again, their motto is ""Never Settle"" and I hope they never settle down and keep innovating.",5.0

124,Awesome mobile at ₹31500,This mobile is really awesomePros:Good camera (both front and rear camera)Night scape mode is good in low light conditionFingerprint sensor and face recognition both are  very fastDisplay is awesomeCons:For me the dissapointed thing in this mobile is battery life. For a normal user it could be last up-to 10hrs but for a heavy users and gamers the battery will last up-to 6-7hrs.In some reviews the users pointed that the speaker which is on right side at the bottom  is not working.After receiving my mobile I checked it. It's really not working.so I searched in YouTube and came to know that it was a microphone.Finally the mobile is very very good.,5.0

157,NEVER SETTLE,"OnePlus- the name itself suggest more than one, and it justify its tagline too.Super fast fluidic experience.First of all price- 8+128 @31499 best in this segment, that's because 1) premium class handset, super build quality. 2) display is very good. 3) battery life is very good as compared to premium Samsung phones which costs around 40+ k. 4) charging speed is best in the market. 5) I was worried about on display fingure print scanner, but it's nice to use, 95%times it's open in first touch. 6) SD845- don't need to describe more, it always deliver, gamer do consider. 7) OS- best in the market- clean, fast, premium class. 8) camera is natural, best for those who don't wants  to show themselves. 9) position of physical button are at their best place, holding it in hand feels best and premium class. 10) in everything it wins than its competitors with a large margin.Just make it your own, it will never settle you.Thanks Amazon for delivering it super fast.Thank you all",5.0

Camera is perfect for night shots and even front facing camera won't fail you even in complete darkness. I love the dash charging in this, it charges Lightning fast!!. Only problem facing till now is with the in-display fingerprint scanner at times it won't recognise your fingerprint and you have to bypass it by facial recognition (which works fine with some light) or pin.",5.0

292,Looks like no more consistent quality control at production line.,"One+ as a company is not trustable for it's consistent nature anymore. They came as a very promising startup and their best product so far was their first mobile One+1. I used that for 28 months and then it was dead. That was ok because of the relatively low cost. Since then the cost of the new mobiles from One+ has more than doubled, and most of the increased value is goings to Amitabh Bachan and marketing gimmicks. Remember One+ 1 was never marketed in any way other than the word of mouth and it was a brilliant product relative to its cost. Never Settle was true to it's phrase and One+ became a trusted brand for its quality. From there onwards the consistent nature of the company was on a degrading trip focusing more on gimmicks than quality. This mobile is not worth more than ₹21000  - 24000 at the most. Lots of defect mobiles is on the market and that shows the lack of quality control in the production line.",1.0

One of the best thing about oneplus devices is that they will give you software support for almost every phone they have ever created so far I am quiet assured that this phone will be last to 3 year without any glitches.One of the major con of this phone that I facing right now is the finger print sensor although it looks and feel good but the speed to unlock the phone that everyone wanted is still missing.
